# Davao Commuters Guide: Privacy Policy

Welcome to the Davao Commuters Guide app for Android! 

This is a closed-source Android app developed by Neil Marc Mejia. The app is available on Google Play. I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge. 

I hereby state, as I have developed the app personally from the ground up, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (app preferences (like language selected, or first time tutorials) as executed by you (the user) is stored on your device only and can be erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.



Davao Commuters Guide takes your privacy seriously. To better protect your privacy Davao Commuters Guide provide this privacy policy notice explaining the permissions and privacy concerning you (the user).



## Collection of Routine Information


Davao Commuters Guide do not track any information about their users. 



## Explanation of permissions requested in the app
The list of permissions required by the app are available in my private repository dvo.commuters.guide in its AndroidManifest.xml file.


```
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />
```


| Permission | Why it is required  
| :---:   | :---: 
| android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION | This is required to allow the app to yield precise location access benefits to the user. This is especially useful for the Follow Live! feature where the user is inside a public utility vehicle and the location pin in the map will show the user accurately as the user is travelling within the bounds of the city. Updates to location are coming from the network provider or gps provider.
| android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION | This is required to allow the app to yield location access benefits to the user especially when the location data comes from the network provider.



If you find any wrong information that has been inadvertently caused by me, my contributors, and or sponsors, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email or post a discussion on GitHub, and I will surely try to fix it/help you.


Yours sincerely,

Neil Marc Mejia

Davao City, Philipines.
